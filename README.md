# smart-attendance
This project proposes an advanced attendance management system leveraging geo-fencing and fingerprint verification to ensure secure and efficient attendance tracking. Teachers can initiate an attendance timer, allowing students within a predefined geo-fenced area (e.g., classroom) to mark attendance via fingerprint authentication, eliminating proxy attendance. The system offers additional features for teachers, including real-time attendance monitoring, restricting student phone usage, uploading notes, issuing notifications, and editing attendance records. Students can view their attendance, access shared notes, and report scheduling discrepancies to request attendance corrections. By integrating biometric verification, location-based tracking, and classroom management tools, this system enhances transparency, accountability, and communication in academic environments.
